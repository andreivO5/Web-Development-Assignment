 Project Description
#####################

The AV Pharmaceuticals website implements the languages HTML, CSS, PHP & SQL in order to create a functioning website that can access databases and carry out user verification. The login information database is used to login as an admin, as well as to register new users, and the products database can be used by a registered user to view the database contents, as well as to add, edit and remove products, their type, and their quantity.

 Project Implementation
########################

The appearance of the website was carried out using HTML and CSS. On the homepage (main.html) I made use of icons and links to further carry out the functionality of the website. The main.css file ensured correct formatting of all elements on the homepage, as well as for the other .php webpages. I designed each webpage to follow a specific path to every process, such as login and registration adding/verifying information from the login database, the products path allowing a registered user to view / make changes to the database. All the database functionality is carried out through PHP code, which is implemented using HTML elements on the according webpage. Adding, editing and deleting elements in the database is all done with the help of SQL code, which is implemented into the webpage with user-friendly text fields that send the information to the database.

Files used in this project: main.html, main.css, logincheck.html, login.php, logout.php, register.php, database.php, add.php, edit.php, delete.php.

For the website to function correctly and to demo each feature, I used the XAMPP Control Panel alongside its MySQL feature to create the two databases.

 What would I add if I had more time:
########################################

I would fix a couple of small design issues, as well as make the website more user-responsive. I would also like to implement more features such as a customer page where they can view all available products with images for each product, and add a shopping cart functionality as well as a fictional purchase functionality.

 Final notes and sources:
##########################

I wrote the entire code for this project myself, using the knowledge I gathered from my Internet App and Web Development module. This was a great learning experience on writing both front-end and back-end development code, and I would like to put it to use in potential future projects.
